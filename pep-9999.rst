Abstract
========

This PEP standardizes configuration of PyPI repositories.


Motivation
==========

Workflow tools come up with their own configuration mechanisms for PyPI repositories, as there is no standard for this. This causes fragmentation and pain points.

Examples of such configuration files:

* Pip's ``pip.conf`` and ``pip.ini``
* Packaging's ``.pypirc`` (also used by tools like Flit and Twine)
* Poetry's ``config.toml`` and ``auth.toml``


Rationale
=========

While this PEP aim to come up with a unified PyPI repository configuration, thought has been given so to be able to extend the configuration later. For example, PyPI repositories are assumed in this PEP, but a ``type`` attribute could be introduced which would default to ``pypi`` down the line, to allow for other package repository types. Any tool could also start taking advantage of the fact that the configuration files and their discovery is a standard, and use this for their own configuration.


Specification
=============

The specification consists of three parts: the configuration definition, package discovery and configuration file discovery.


Configuration definition
------------------------

The configuration is split into two files:

* ``config.toml`` for PyPI repository configuration
* ``auth.toml`` for credentials


The config.toml file
''''''''''''''''''''

Package index configuration is defined in the ``config.toml`` file, under the ``[repositories]`` section::


    [repositories]

    [repostiories.pypi]
    url = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

    [repostiories.myrepo1]
    url = "http://myserver2.org/simple"


A repository has the following attributes::

    ==================  ===========  =============================================
    Attribute           Type         Description
    ==================  ===========  =============================================
    final               bool         Make it impossible to override/remove the repository configuration (default: false)
    proxy_url           str          The URL to the proxy server, can contain a port
    shadow              bool         Use package from this index, even if it was found in a previous index (default: false)
    url                 str          URL to repository
    ==================  ===========  =============================================


The auth.toml file
''''''''''''''''''

Credentials are stored in the ``auth.toml`` file, under the ``[authentication]`` section. There is a correlation between the repository name and the authentication section's name::

    [authentication]

    [authentication.pypi]
    username = "__token__"
    password = "pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcCJDJjMmI5NDJmLWIzNzQtNDc3ZC04ZmRkLTM4NDEzY2M1ZTU5MAACJXsicGVybWlzc2lvbnMiOiAidXNlciIsICJ2ZXJzaW9uIjogMX0AAAYgV91r8iEUUz7Q5xbsfi_KGiO3wrJR2_IOOpnFyLo62bk"

    [authentication.myrepo1]
    username = "foo"
    password = "YmFyCg=="


Instead of specifying the credentials in this file, Keyring can be used::

    keyring set https://pypi.org/simple/ __token__
    keyring set <repository URL> <private-repository username>


A repository's credentials has the following attributes::

    ==================  ===========  ===============================================
    Attribute           Type         Description
    ==================  ===========  ===============================================
    cert                str          Path to certificate authority bundle (*.pem)
    cert-client         str          Path to client certificate (*.pem)
    enabled             bool         Whether the repository should be used or not (default: true)
    password            str          The password for the repository, base64-encoded. When token is used, enter it here in clear-text.
    proxy_password      str          The password for the proxy server, base64-encoded.
    proxy_username      str          The username for the proxy server
    username            str          The username for the repository.
    ==================  ===========  ===============================================


Package discovery
-----------------

The PyPI repository (``repositories.pypi``) does not have to be specified in the ``config.toml``. If not specified, it will be used as the first package index by default. However, by explicitly defining it, the repository attributes can be used and it can be ordered differently.

The order of the repository definitions in ``config.toml`` shall be respected when searching for packages. This allows custom package indexes to take precendence over e.g. a default PyPI repository and the use of package shadowing.


Configuration file discovery
----------------------------

The locations of the configuration files vary slightly across platforms. You may have per-user, per-virtualenv or global (shared amongst all users) configuration:

If multiple configuration files are found, then they are combined (merge and override) in the following order:

1. The global file is read
2. The per-user file is read
3. The virtualenv-specific file is read

Each file read overrides any values read from previous files.


Global
''''''

* Unix: ``/etc/.config/python/``
* macOS: ``/Library/Application Support/python/``
* Windows: ``%APPDATA%\python\``


Per-user
''''''''

* Unix: ``$HOME/.config/python/``
* macOS: ``$HOME/.config/python/``
* Windows: ``%APPDATA%\python\``


Per-virtualenv
''''''''''''''

* Unix: ``$VIRTUAL_ENV/.python/``
* macOS: ``$VIRTUAL_ENV/.python/``
* Windows: ``%VIRTUAL_ENV%\.python\``
