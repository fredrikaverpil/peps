Abstract
========

This PEP standardizes configuration of PyPI repository package indexes.


Motivation
==========

Workflow tools come up with their own configuration mechanisms for PyPI package indexes, as there is no standard for this. This causes fragmentation and pain points.

Examples of such configuration files:

* Pip's ``pip.conf`` and ``pip.ini``
* Packaging's ``.pypirc`` (also used by tools like Flit and Twine)
* Poetry's ``config.toml`` and ``auth.toml``


Rationale
=========


Specification
=============

The specification consists of three parts: the configuration definition, package discovery and configuration file discovery.


Configuration definition
------------------------


The config.toml file
''''''''''''''''''''

Package index configuration is defined in the ``config.toml`` file, under the ``[repositories]`` section::


    [repositories]

    [repostiories.pypi]
    url = "https://pypi.org/simple/"

    [repostiories.myrepo1]
    url = "http://myserver2.org/simple"


A repository has the following options::

    ==================  ===========  =============================================
    Option              Type         Description
    ==================  ===========  =============================================
    proxy_port          int          The port of the proxy server to use (default: 80)
    proxy_url           str          The URL to the proxy server
    shadow              bool         Use package from this index, even if it was found in a previous index (default: false)
    type                str          Package index type (default: pypi)
    url                 str          URL to repository
    ==================  ===========  =============================================


The auth.toml file
''''''''''''''''''

Credentials are stored in the ``auth.toml`` file, under the ``[authentication]`` section. There is a correlation between the repository name and the authentication section's name::

    [authentication]

    [authentication.pypi]
    token = "pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcCJDJjMmI5NDJmLWIzNzQtNDc3ZC04ZmRkLTM4NDEzY2M1ZTU5MAACJXsicGVybWlzc2lvbnMiOiAidXNlciIsICJ2ZXJzaW9uIjogMX0AAAYgV91r8iEUUz7Q5xbsfi_KGiO3wrJR2_IOOpnFyLo62bk"

    [authentication.myrepo1]
    username = "foo"
    password = "YmFyCg=="



Instead of specifying the credentials in this file, Keyring can be used::

    Example needed here...


A repository's credentials has the following options::

    ==================  ===========  ===============================================
    Option              Type         Description
    ==================  ===========  ===============================================
    cert                str          Path to certificate authority bundle (*.pem)
    cert-client         str          Path to client certificate (*.pem)
    password            str          The password for the repository, base64-encoded. When token is used, enter it here.
    proxy_password      str          The password for the proxy server, base64-encoded.
    proxy_username      str          The username for the proxy server
    token               str          When token should be used instead of username and password
    username            str          The username for the repository
    ==================  ===========  ===============================================


Package discovery
-----------------

The order of the repository definitions in ``config.toml`` shall be respected when searching for packages. This allows custom package indexes to take precendence over e.g. a default PyPI repository and the use of package shadowing.

The PyPI repository (``repositories.pypi``) does not have to specified in the ``config.toml``. If not specified, it will used as the first package index. By explicitly defining it, the repository options can be used and it can be ordered differently.


Configuration file discovery
